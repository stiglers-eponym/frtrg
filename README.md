# FRTRG
Floquet real-time renormalization group for the isotropic single-channel Kondo model.
The method implemented here can be used to describe strongly correlated open quantum systems at zero temperature with time-dependent driving.
See [Phys. Rev. B **106**, 115440 (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.115440) for an explanation of the method.
